### Commands: 
### **11. General Directory Structure in the Coursework**

- **Directories to Know**:
    - `/rds/project/rds-xyBFuSj0hm0/MLMI2.M2024`: Shared base directory with original files.
    - `/rds/user/CRSid/hpc-work/MLMI2`: Your personal working directory for the coursework.
    - `exp/`: Folder containing scripts and data (e.g., `trainer.py`, `decoder.py`).

### **1. Navigating to the Base Directory**

- **Command**: `cd /rds/project/rds-xyBFuSj0hm0/MLMI2.M2024`

- **Description**: This command takes you to the base directory containing all the coursework scripts, data files, and resources. It's the starting point for accessing the provided files like `run.py`, `trainer.py`, and the `json` files.

---

### **2. Navigating to Your Working Directory**

- **Command**: `cd /rds/user/jaf98/hpc-work/MLMI2`

- **Description**: This command moves you to your own working directory, where you'll copy and modify the code for experiments. This ensures you don't accidentally alter shared files in the base directory.

---

### **3. Copying Code to the Working Directory**

- **Command**: 
`cp -r /rds/project/rds-xyBFuSj0hm0/MLMI2.M2024/exp ./ cd exp/`

- **Description**:
    - The `cp -r` command copies the `exp/` folder (containing the coursework code) from the base directory to your working directory.
    - The `cd exp/` command navigates into the `exp/` folder within your working directory, where you'll execute scripts and manage code modifications.

---
### **7. Navigating Within Interactive Nodes**

- **Command**: `cd ~ cd /rds/user/jaf98/hpc-work/MLMI2`
    
- **Description**: Once an interactive node is allocated, you will be redirected to your home directory. Use the `cd` command to navigate back to your working directory.

---

### **8. Activating the Environment**

- **Command**: Before running scripts:
`cd /rds/user/CRSid/hpc-work/MLMI2/exp source /rds/project/rds-xyBFuSj0hm0/MLMI2.M2024/miniconda3/bin/activate conda activate py25`

- **Description**:
    - The `cd` command navigates into the `exp/` folder where the scripts are located.
    - The `source` and `conda activate` commands activate the Anaconda virtual environment needed to execute the Python scripts.

---

### **9. Navigating for Jupyter Notebook Setup**

- **Command**:
`cd /rds/user/jaf98/hpc-work/MLMI2`

- **Description**: Before starting a Jupyter Notebook session on an allocated interactive node, navigate to your working directory to access the notebook and associated scripts.

---

### **10. Navigating Between Nodes**

- **Command**: To move between login nodes:
`ssh login-q-1`

Or from inside an active session:
`ssh login-p-1`

- **Description**: Use SSH commands to move between nodes without navigating from the local machine. This is useful for accessing specific computational resources.
