## Introduction
Clifford (or geometric) algebras provide a powerful mathematical framework for representing geometric concepts and transformations in a unified manner. They have been extensively used in physics to model spinors, Dirac matrices, Maxwell's equations, Lorentz transformations, and more.

In machine learning, Clifford Group Equivariant Neural Networks (CGENNs) leverage Clifford algebras to maintain geometric symmetries and equivariance with respect to groups such as $O(n)$, $SO(n)$, $E(n)$, and $SE(n)$. However, previous works have limited internal network representations to fixed diagonal metrics (Euclidean or Minkowski), which must be chosen a priori and may not capture the complexities of the data.

This work proposes an extension to CGENNs by integrating learnable metrics, allowing the network to adapt its internal representations dynamically in a data-driven fashion. The main contributions are:

1. Extension of CGENNs to include learnable metrics, enabling more flexible internal representations.
2. Use of eigenvalue decomposition to integrate the learnable metric into CGENNs while ensuring computational tractability.
3. Theoretical justification using category theory, explaining Clifford algebras as categorical constructions and ensuring mathematical soundness.

## Background

### Inner Product and Metric Spaces
An inner product on a vector space $V$ over a field $K$ (usually $R$ or $C$) is a map $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle : V \times V \rightarrow K$ satisfying:

1. **Conjugate Symmetry**: $\langle x, y \rangle = \overline{\langle y, x \rangle}$, $\forall x, y \in V$.
2. **Linearity in the First Argument**: $\langle ax + by, z \rangle = a \langle x, z \rangle + b \langle y, z \rangle$, $\forall x, y, z \in V, \forall a, b \in K$.
3. **Positive-Definiteness**: $\langle x, x \rangle > 0, \forall x \neq 0$.

The inner product induces a norm $\| \cdot \|$ on $V$ defined by:

$$ \| x \| = \sqrt{\langle x, x \rangle}. $$

A metric space $(V, d)$ is then defined by the distance function:

$$ d(x, y) = \| x - y \|. $$

In matrix form, the inner product can be represented as:

$$ \langle x, y \rangle = x^\top Q y, $$

where $Q$ is a symmetric positive-definite matrix (the metric tensor).

### Clifford Algebras
A Clifford algebra $Cl(V, Q)$ is an associative algebra generated by a vector space $V$ equipped with a quadratic form $Q$. It extends the vector space $V$ to include scalars, bivectors, trivectors, and higher-grade elements.

#### Definition
Given a vector space $V$ over $K$ and a quadratic form $Q: V \rightarrow K$, the Clifford algebra $Cl(V, Q)$ is the quotient of the tensor algebra $T(V)$ by the two-sided ideal generated by:

$$ v \otimes v - Q(v) \cdot 1, \forall v \in V. $$

The geometric product of two vectors $v, w \in V$ in the Clifford algebra is defined as:

$$ vw = \langle v, w \rangle + v \wedge w, $$

where:

- $\langle v, w \rangle$ is the inner product (symmetric part).
- $v \wedge w$ is the outer product (antisymmetric part), representing the bivector component.

#### Basis and Multivectors
An orthogonal basis $\{ e_1, e_2, \dots, e_n \}$ for $V$ allows us to represent elements of $Cl(V, Q)$ as multivectors:

$$ x = x^{(0)} \cdot 1 + x^{(1)} e_1 + x^{(2)} e_2 + \cdots + x^{(12)} e_1 e_2 + \cdots + x^{(12\dots n)} e_1 e_2 \dots e_n. $$

The dimension of $Cl(V, Q)$ is $2^n$, where $n = \dim V$.

### Clifford Group
The Clifford group $Cl^\times (V, Q)$ consists of invertible elements in $Cl(V, Q)$ with respect to the geometric product. It can represent geometric transformations such as rotations, reflections, and translations.

### Norms in Clifford Algebras
To define norms in $Cl(V, Q)$, we extend the quadratic form $Q$ to multivectors. For $x \in Cl(V, Q)$, the norm is defined using the main anti-involution $\beta$:

$$ \beta(x) = \text{reverse}(x), $$

which reverses the order of basis elements in each grade.

Then, the quadratic form is:

$$ Q(x) = b(x, x) = (\beta(x) x)^{(0)}, $$

where $(\cdot)^{(0)}$ denotes the scalar part.

The norm is then:

$$ \| x \| = \sqrt{Q(x)}. $$

### Eigenvalue Decomposition
Given a symmetric matrix $M \in K^{n \times n}$, we can perform an eigenvalue decomposition:

$$ M = P^{-1} \Delta P, $$

where:

- $P$ is an invertible matrix whose columns are eigenvectors of $M$.
- $\Delta$ is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues.

This decomposition allows us to diagonalize the metric $M$, facilitating computations.

#### Basics of Category Theory
Category theory provides a high-level framework for mathematical structures and their relationships.

A category $C$ consists of:

- Objects.
- Morphisms (arrows) between objects.
- Composition of morphisms satisfying associativity and identity laws.

A functor $F: C \rightarrow D$ maps objects and morphisms from category $C$ to category $D$, preserving the categorical structure.

#### Application to Clifford Algebras
Clifford algebras can be viewed as a categorical construction, where the algebra $Cl(V, Q)$ is functorially related to the vector space $V$ with quadratic form $Q$.

## Clifford Group Equivariant Neural Networks (CGENNs)
CGENNs leverage Clifford algebras to construct neural networks that are equivariant under the action of the Clifford group.

### Key Components

1. **Algebra Embeddings**: Map input data into the Clifford algebra.

   - For scalar input $x$: $$ \text{Embed}(x) = x \cdot 1. $$
   - For vector input $v \in V$: $$ \text{Embed}(v) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} v_i e_i. $$

2. **Linear Layers**: Perform grade-wise linear transformations.

   For multivectors $x^{(k)}$ of grade $k$:
   
   $$ y^{\text{out}}^{(k)} = \sum_{\text{in}} \phi^{\text{in,out}}_k x^{\text{in}}^{(k)}, $$

   where $\phi^{\text{in,out}}_k$ are learnable scalar parameters.

3. **Geometric Product Layers**: Allow interaction between different grades using the geometric product.

   Defined as:

   $$ P_\phi(x_1, x_2)^{(k)} = \sum_{i=0}^{n} \sum_{j=0}^{n} \phi_{ij}^{k} (x_1^{(i)} x_2^{(j)})^{(k)}, $$

   where $\phi_{ij}^{k}$ are learnable scalars.

4. **Normalization**: Ensure numerical stability using equivariant normalization.

   For $x^{(k)}$:
   
   $$ \text{Norm}(x^{(k)}) = \frac{x^{(k)}}{\sigma(a^{(k)} (Q(x^{(k)}) - 1) + 1)}, $$

   where $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function, and $a^{(k)}$ are learnable parameters.

5. **Nonlinearities**: Applied grade-wise to maintain equivariance.

   For $x \in Cl(V, Q)$:

   $$ \text{NonLinear}^{(k)}(x) = \psi(f^{(k)}(x)) \cdot x^{(k)}, $$

   where $\psi$ is a non-linear activation function, and $f^{(k)}$ is a linear function of the components of $x^{(k)}$.
