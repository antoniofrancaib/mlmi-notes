### 2. Evaluating Integrals Numerically

#### 2.1 The Challenge of Numerical Integration

Consider the integral:

$$
I = \int_0^1 e^{-x^3} \, dx
$$

- **No Analytic Solution**: The integral lacks a closed-form solution; we cannot express it using elementary functions.
- **Need for Numerical Methods**: We must approximate the integral using numerical techniques.

#### 2.2 Deterministic Numerical Approaches

- **2.2.1 Midpoint Rule**: Approximates the integral by evaluating the function at the midpoint:

  $$
  I \approx (b - a) \cdot f \left( \frac{a + b}{2} \right)
  $$

- **2.2.2 Trapezoidal Rule**: Uses the average of function values at the endpoints:

  $$
  I \approx \frac{(b - a)}{2} [f(a) + f(b)]
  $$

- **2.2.3 Higher-Order Quadrature Rules**
  - **Simpson's Rule, Gaussian Quadrature**: Provide better accuracy by considering more function evaluations and weighting them appropriately.
  - **Accuracy Consideration**: Defined by the error between the approximation and the true value.

#### 2.3 Limitations in Higher Dimensions

- **Curse of Dimensionality**: The computational cost increases exponentially with the number of dimensions.
- **Grid-Based Methods**: Infeasible for high-dimensional integrals due to the exponential growth in required evaluation points.

#### 2.4 The Monte Carlo Approach

- **Stochastic Computation**: Uses randomness to sample points in the integration domain.
- **Dimensionality Independence**: The method's efficiency does not degrade significantly with higher dimensions.

### 3. Evaluating Statistical Expectations

#### 3.1 Rewriting the Integral

We can express the integral as an expectation:

$$
I = \int_a^b f(x) \, dx = \int_a^b \frac{f(x)}{p(x)} p(x) \, dx = \mathbb{E}_p \left[ \frac{f(x)}{p(x)} \right]
$$

- **$p(x)$**: A probability density function defined on $[a, b]$.
- **Random Variable Interpretation**: $x$ is treated as a random variable drawn from $p(x)$.

#### 3.2 Uniform Distribution Case

If $p(x)$ is uniform on $[a, b]$, then $p(x) = \frac{1}{b - a}$:

$$
I = (b - a) \cdot \mathbb{E}_p[f(x)]
$$

- **Expectation under Uniform Distribution**: Simplifies computation by sampling uniformly.

#### 3.3 Monte Carlo Estimation

- **Estimate of the Expectation**:

  $$
  \mathbb{E}_p[f(x)] \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N f(u_n)
  $$

  where $u_n$ are independent samples uniformly drawn from $[a, b]$.

#### 3.4 Comparison with Deterministic Methods

- **Monte Carlo**: Uses random samples.
- **Riemann Sum**: Uses evenly spaced deterministic points.

### 4. Central Limit Theorem and Convergence

#### 4.1 Law of Large Numbers (LLN)

- **Convergence**: The sample mean converges to the expected value as $N \to \infty$.
- **Unbiasedness**: The Monte Carlo estimate is unbiased—its expected value equals the true expectation.

#### 4.2 Central Limit Theorem (CLT)

- **Standard CLT**: For independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables with finite mean and variance, the normalized sum converges in distribution to a normal distribution.

#### 4.3 Applying CLT to Monte Carlo Estimates

- **4.3.1 Setup**

  Let $f_n = f(x_n)$ with $x_n$ drawn from $p(x)$.

  - **Mean**: $\mathbb{E}[f_n] = \mu$.
  - **Variance**: $\text{Var}(f_n) = \sigma^2$.

- **4.3.2 Normalization and MGF**

  - **Sum**: $S_N = \sum_{n=1}^N f_n$.

  - **Normalized Sum**:

    $$
    Z_N = \frac{S_N - N\mu}{\sigma \sqrt{N}}
    $$

  - **Moment-Generating Function (MGF)**:

    $$
    M_{Z_N}(t) = \left( M_f \left( \frac{t}{\sigma \sqrt{N}} \right) \right)^N
    $$

    where $M_f(t) = \mathbb{E}[e^{t f_n}]$.

- **4.3.3 Convergence to Normal Distribution**

  - **MGF Approximation**:

    $$
    M_{Z_N}(t) \approx \exp \left( \frac{t^2}{2} \right) \text{ as } N \to \infty
    $$

  - **Implication**: $Z_N$ converges in distribution to $N(0, 1)$.

#### 4.4 Implications for Monte Carlo Estimates

- **Distribution of Estimates**:

  $$
  \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N f_n \sim N\left(\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{N}\right)
  $$

- **Standard Error**:

  $$
  SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{N}}
  $$

- **Convergence Rate**:

  - **Rate**: $O\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\right)$.
  - **Interpretation**: Doubling the number of samples reduces the standard error by a factor of $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$.

#### 4.5 Factors Affecting Convergence

- **4.5.1 Function Variance ($\sigma^2$)**
  - **High Variance**: Slower convergence; requires more samples.
  - **Low Variance**: Faster convergence.

- **4.5.2 Function Characteristics**
  - **Sharp Peaks**: Functions with narrow peaks may lead to higher variance.
  - **Smoothness**: Smoother functions generally have lower variance.

### 5. Rates of Convergence

#### 5.1 The Role of Function Variance

- **Variance as a Rate Constant**: The inherent variance of $f(x)$ determines the convergence rate.
- **Variance Reduction Techniques**: Methods like importance sampling can reduce variance.

#### 5.2 Multidimensional Integrals

- **Dimensional Independence**: Monte Carlo convergence rate does not deteriorate with higher dimensions, unlike deterministic methods.
- **Curse of Dimensionality Mitigation**: Monte Carlo methods remain practical for high-dimensional integrals.
