## Introduction
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have revolutionized statistical computation, particularly in Bayesian inference and high-dimensional integration. The Gibbs sampler is one of the most widely used MCMC algorithms due to its simplicity and effectiveness in sampling from complex, high-dimensional distributions.

This masterclass aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the Gibbs sampler. We will explore its theoretical foundations, derive its properties rigorously, and contextualize its application in multivariate settings. By the end of this masterclass, you will have a thorough grasp of how the Gibbs sampler works, why it converges to the correct target distribution, and how it can be effectively implemented in practice.

## 1. Background on MCMC and Markov Chains
Before diving into the Gibbs sampler, it's essential to understand the underlying principles of Markov chains and how they relate to MCMC methods.

### Markov Chains and Transition Kernels
A Markov chain is a stochastic process $\{X_n\}_{n=0}^{\infty}$ where the probability of transitioning to the next state depends only on the current state and not on the sequence of events that preceded it. Formally:

$$
P(X_{n+1} \in A \mid X_n = x, X_{n-1} = x_{n-1}, \ldots, X_0 = x_0) = P(X_{n+1} \in A \mid X_n = x)
$$

#### Transition Kernels
The transition kernel $P(x, dy)$ defines the probabilities of moving from state $x$ to a set of states $dy$:

- For discrete state spaces, $P(x, y)$ is a probability mass function.
- For continuous state spaces, $P(x, dy)$ is a probability measure satisfying:

$$
\int P(x, dy) = 1 \quad \text{for all } x
$$

### Invariant Distributions and Convergence
An invariant distribution (or stationary distribution) $\pi$ of a Markov chain satisfies:

$$
\int P(x, dy) \pi(x) dx = \pi(dy)
$$

This means that if the chain starts with the distribution $\pi$, it remains in $\pi$ after each transition.

#### Convergence to the Invariant Distribution
Under certain conditions (irreducibility, aperiodicity, and positive recurrence), a Markov chain will converge to its invariant distribution regardless of the initial state. This property is fundamental in MCMC methods, where we construct chains that converge to a target distribution $\pi$ from which we wish to sample.

## 2. Product Transition Kernels
In high-dimensional settings, dealing with the full joint distribution directly can be challenging. One strategy is to break the multivariate distribution into sub-blocks and design transition kernels for each block.

### Decomposing Multivariate Distributions
Consider a random vector $x = (x_1, x_2)$ where:

- $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$
- $x_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{d_1}$
- $x_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{d_2}$
- $d_1 + d_2 = d$

We aim to construct transition kernels that operate on $x_1$ and $x_2$ separately while ensuring convergence to the correct target distribution $\pi(x)$.

### Constructing Product Kernels
We define two conditional transition kernels:

- **Kernel for $x_1$ given $x_2$:**

  $$P_1(x_1, dy_1 \mid x_2)$$

  This kernel has an invariant density $\pi_{1|2}(y_1 \mid x_2)$ for fixed $x_2$.

- **Kernel for $x_2$ given $x_1$:**

  $$P_2(x_2, dy_2 \mid x_1)$$

  This kernel has an invariant density $\pi_{2|1}(y_2 \mid x_1)$ for fixed $x_1$.

We construct a product transition kernel by sequentially applying $P_1$ and $P_2$:

$$
P(x, dy) = P_1(x_1, dy_1 \mid x_2) \cdot P_2(x_2, dy_2 \mid y_1)
$$

Our goal is to prove that this product kernel has $\pi(x)$ as its invariant density.

### Proof of Invariance
We need to show that:

$$
\int \int P_1(x_1, dy_1 \mid x_2) P_2(x_2, dy_2 \mid y_1) \pi(x_1, x_2) dx_1 dx_2 = \pi(dy_1, dy_2)
$$

#### Detailed Proof
Let's break down the left-hand side (LHS):

1. Start with the joint integral:

   $$
   \text{LHS} = \int_{\mathbb{R}^{d_1}} \int_{\mathbb{R}^{d_2}} P_1(x_1, dy_1 \mid x_2) P_2(x_2, dy_2 \mid y_1) \pi(x_1, x_2) dx_1 dx_2
   $$

2. Integrate over $x_1$ using the invariant property of $P_1$:

   $$
   \text{LHS} = \int_{\mathbb{R}^{d_2}} P_2(x_2, dy_2 \mid y_1) \left[\int_{\mathbb{R}^{d_1}} P_1(x_1, dy_1 \mid x_2) \pi_{1|2}(x_1 \mid x_2) dx_1\right] \pi_2(x_2) dx_2
   $$

   Here, $\pi_{1|2}(x_1 \mid x_2)$ is the conditional density of $x_1$ given $x_2$, and $\pi_2(x_2)$ is the marginal density of $x_2$.

   ... (and so on with the rest of the derivation)
