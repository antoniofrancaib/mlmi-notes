## Introduction
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have revolutionized statistical computation, particularly in Bayesian inference and high-dimensional integration. The Gibbs sampler is one of the most widely used MCMC algorithms due to its simplicity and effectiveness in sampling from complex, high-dimensional distributions.

## 1. Background on MCMC and Markov Chains
Before diving into the Gibbs sampler, it's essential to understand the underlying principles of Markov chains and how they relate to MCMC methods.

### Markov Chains and Transition Kernels
A Markov chain is a stochastic process $\{X_n\}_{n=0}^{\infty}$ where the probability of transitioning to the next state depends only on the current state and not on the sequence of events that preceded it. Formally:
$$
P(X_{n+1} \in A \mid X_n = x, X_{n-1} = x_{n-1}, \ldots, X_0 = x_0) = P(X_{n+1} \in A \mid X_n = x)
$$

#### Transition Kernels
The transition kernel $P(x, dy)$ defines the probabilities of moving from state $x$ to a set of states $dy$:

- For discrete state spaces, $P(x, y)$ is a probability mass function.
- For continuous state spaces, $P(x, dy)$ is a probability measure satisfying:

$$
\int P(x, dy) = 1 \quad \text{for all } x
$$

### Invariant Distributions and Convergence
An invariant distribution (or stationary distribution) $\pi$ of a Markov chain satisfies:
$$
\int P(x, dy) \pi(x) dx = \pi(dy)
$$

This means that if the chain starts with the distribution $\pi$, it remains in $\pi$ after each transition.

#### Convergence to the Invariant Distribution
Under certain conditions (irreducibility, aperiodicity, and positive recurrence), a Markov chain will converge to its invariant distribution regardless of the initial state. This property is fundamental in MCMC methods, where we construct chains that converge to a target distribution $\pi$ from which we wish to sample.

## 2. Product Transition Kernels

In high-dimensional settings, dealing with the full joint distribution directly can be challenging. One strategy is to break the multivariate distribution into sub-blocks and design transition kernels for each block.

### Decomposing Multivariate Distributions
Consider a random vector $x = (x_1, x_2)$ where:
- $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$
- $x_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{d_1}$
- $x_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{d_2}$
- $d_1 + d_2 = d$

We aim to construct transition kernels that operate on $x_1$ and $x_2$ separately while ensuring convergence to the correct target distribution $\pi(x)$.

### Constructing Product Kernels
We define two conditional transition kernels:

1. **Kernel for $x_1$ given $x_2$:**   $$P_1(x_1, dy_1 \mid x_2)$$
   This kernel has an invariant density $\pi_{1 \mid 2}(y_1 \mid x_2)$ for fixed $x_2$.

2. **Kernel for $x_2$ given $x_1$:**   $$P_2(x_2, dy_2 \mid x_1)$$
   This kernel has an invariant density $\pi_{2 \mid 1}(y_2 \mid x_1)$ for fixed $x_1$.

We construct a product transition kernel by sequentially applying $P_1$ and $P_2$:
$$P(x, dy) = P_1(x_1, dy_1 \mid x_2) \cdot P_2(x_2, dy_2 \mid y_1)$$

Our goal is to prove that this product kernel has $\pi(x)$ as its invariant density.

### Proof of Invariance
We need to show that:
$$\int \int P_1(x_1, dy_1 \mid x_2) P_2(x_2, dy_2 \mid y_1) \pi(x_1, x_2) dx_1 dx_2 = \pi(dy_1, dy_2)$$

**Detailed Proof:**

Let's break down the left-hand side (LHS):

1. **Start with the joint integral:**$$\text{LHS} = \int_{\mathbb{R}^{d_1}} \int_{\mathbb{R}^{d_2}} P_1(x_1, dy_1 \mid x_2) P_2(x_2, dy_2 \mid y_1) \pi(x_1, x_2) dx_1 dx_2$$
2. **Integrate over $x_1$ using the invariant property of $P_1$:**$$\text{LHS} = \int_{\mathbb{R}^{d_2}} P_2(x_2, dy_2 \mid y_1) \left[ \int_{\mathbb{R}^{d_1}} P_1(x_1, dy_1 \mid x_2) \pi_{1 \mid 2}(x_1 \mid x_2) dx_1 \right] \pi_2(x_2) dx_2$$Here, $\pi_{1 \mid 2}(x_1 \mid x_2)$ is the conditional density of $x_1$ given $x_2$, and $\pi_2(x_2)$ is the marginal density of $x_2$.

3. **Use the invariance of $P_1$ to simplify:**$$\int_{\mathbb{R}^{d_1}} P_1(x_1, dy_1 \mid x_2) \pi_{1 \mid 2}(x_1 \mid x_2) dx_1 = \pi_{1 \mid 2}(dy_1 \mid x_2)$$
4. **Substitute back into the expression:**$$\text{LHS} = \int_{\mathbb{R}^{d_2}} P_2(x_2, dy_2 \mid y_1) \pi_{1 \mid 2}(dy_1 \mid x_2) \pi_2(x_2) dx_2$$
5. **Express $\pi_{1 \mid 2}(dy_1 \mid x_2)$ in terms of joint densities:**$$\pi_{1 \mid 2}(dy_1 \mid x_2) = \frac{\pi(dy_1, x_2)}{\pi_2(x_2)}$$
6. **Substitute back and simplify:**
$$\text{LHS} = \int_{\mathbb{R}^{d_2}} P_2(x_2, dy_2 \mid y_1) \pi(dy_1, x_2) dx_2$$

7. **Integrate over $x_2$ using the invariance of $P_2$:**

   Since $P_2$ has $\pi_{2 \mid 1}(y_2 \mid y_1)$ as its invariant density for fixed $y_1$:
$$\int_{\mathbb{R}^{d_2}} P_2(x_2, dy_2 \mid y_1) \pi_{2 \mid 1}(x_2 \mid y_1) dx_2 = \pi_{2 \mid 1}(dy_2 \mid y_1)$$

Therefore:
$$\text{LHS} = \pi(dy_1, dy_2)$$

Since $\pi(dy_1, dy_2) = \pi_{1 \mid 2}(dy_1 \mid y_2) \pi_2(dy_2)$.

### Conclusion
The product kernel $P(x, dy)$ has $\pi(x)$ as its invariant density. This result is crucial because it allows us to construct Markov chains that sample from the target distribution by updating subsets of variables sequentially.

## 3. The Gibbs Sampler

The Gibbs sampler is a specific MCMC algorithm that leverages the idea of product transition kernels to sample from multivariate distributions by sequentially sampling from their conditional distributions.

### Definition and Algorithm
Given a target distribution $\pi(x)$ where $x = (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_p)$, the Gibbs sampler operates by sampling each component $x_i$ from its conditional distribution given the current values of all other components.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1. **Initialize:** Choose an initial state $x^{(0)} = (x_1^{(0)}, x_2^{(0)}, \dots, x_p^{(0)})$.

2. **Iteration ($t \geq 1$):**

   For each component $i = 1, 2, \dots, p$:
   
   - Sample $x_i^{(t)}$ from the conditional distribution:$$x_i^{(t)} \sim \pi(x_i \mid x_1^{(t)}, \dots, x_{i-1}^{(t)}, x_{i+1}^{(t-1)}, \dots, x_p^{(t-1)})$$
   - Update the state to $x^{(t)} = (x_1^{(t)}, x_2^{(t)}, \dots, x_p^{(t)})$.

3. **Repeat:** Continue for the desired number of iterations.

### Acceptance Probability and Reversibility
In the Gibbs sampler, the acceptance probability for each update is always 1. This is because we sample directly from the conditional distributions, ensuring that the detailed balance condition is satisfied without the need for rejection.

### Detailed Balance in Gibbs Sampling
For transitions from $x$ to $y$, the detailed balance condition requires:
$$\pi(x) P(x, y) = \pi(y) P(y, x)$$

In Gibbs sampling, since we sample $y_i$ from $\pi(y_i \mid x_{-i})$, where $x_{-i}$ denotes all components except $x_i$, we have:
$$P(x, y) = \pi(y_i \mid x_{-i}) \delta_{x_{-i}}(y_{-i})$$

This represents the probability of moving from $x$ to $y$ by updating $x_i$ to $y_i$ while keeping the other components the same.

Substituting into the detailed balance condition:
$$\pi(x) \pi(y_i \mid x_{-i}) = \pi(y) \pi(x_i \mid y_{-i})$$

But since $\pi(x) = \pi(x_i, x_{-i}) = \pi(x_i \mid x_{-i}) \pi(x_{-i})$, and similarly for $\pi(y)$, the equation holds true.

### Connection to Metropolis-Hastings
The Gibbs sampler can be viewed as a special case of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm where the acceptance probability is always 1. Specifically, if we use the conditional distribution $\pi(x_i \mid x_{-i})$ as the proposal distribution, the acceptance ratio becomes:

$$\alpha(x, y) = \min\left(1, \frac{\pi(y) q(y, x)}{\pi(x) q(x, y)}\right) = 1$$

This is because:

- $q(x, y) = \pi(y_i \mid x_{-i})$
- $q(y, x) = \pi(x_i \mid y_{-i})$
- $\pi(x) = \pi(x_i \mid x_{-i}) \pi(x_{-i})$
- $\pi(y) = \pi(y_i \mid y_{-i}) \pi(y_{-i})$

Given that $x_{-i} = y_{-i}$, the terms cancel out, leading to $\alpha(x, y) = 1$.

## 4. Gibbs Sampler in Practice
To illustrate the Gibbs sampler's practical application, let's consider a bivariate normal distribution.

### Bivariate Normal Distribution Example

**Target Distribution**

Let $x = (x_1, x_2)$ follow a bivariate normal distribution:
$$(x_1, x_2) \sim N\left(\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 1 & \rho \\ \rho & 1 \end{pmatrix}\right)$$
**Conditional Distributions**

The conditional distributions of $x_1$ and $x_2$ are:

- $x_1 \mid x_2 \sim N(\rho x_2, 1 - \rho^2)$
- $x_2 \mid x_1 \sim N(\rho x_1, 1 - \rho^2)$

**Gibbs Sampling Steps**

1. **Initialize:** Choose initial values $x_1^{(0)}$ and $x_2^{(0)}$.

2. **Iteration ($t \geq 1$):**

   - Sample $x_1^{(t)} \sim N(\rho x_2^{(t-1)}, 1 - \rho^2)$.
   - Sample $x_2^{(t)} \sim N(\rho x_1^{(t)}, 1 - \rho^2)$.

3. **Repeat:** Continue for the desired number of iterations.

### Issues with Proposal Distributions
If we were to use a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with a simple proposal distribution like $q(x, y) = N(y \mid x, \sigma^2 I)$, we might face issues:

- **High Correlation:** If $\rho$ is close to 1 or -1, the components are highly correlated, and the random walk proposal may not efficiently explore the space.
- **Low Acceptance Rates:** The acceptance probability may become very small if the proposed moves do not align with the target distribution's structure.

### Advantages of the Gibbs Sampler
- **Exact Sampling from Conditionals:** By sampling from the exact conditional distributions, the Gibbs sampler efficiently explores the target distribution, even in the presence of high correlations.
- **Acceptance Probability of 1:** Eliminates the need to compute acceptance ratios, simplifying the algorithm.

## 5. Mixture Transition Kernels

In some situations, combining multiple transition kernels can improve the mixing and convergence of the Markov chain.

### Combining Multiple Kernels
Suppose we have two transition kernels $P_1(x, dy)$ and $P_2(x, dy)$, both having $\pi(x)$ as their invariant distribution. We can construct a mixture kernel:
$$P_{\text{mix}}(x, dy) = \gamma P_1(x, dy) + (1 - \gamma) P_2(x, dy)$$

where $0 \leq \gamma \leq 1$ is a mixing probability.

### Invariant Distributions of Mixtures
We can show that $P_{\text{mix}}(x, dy)$ also has $\pi(x)$ as its invariant distribution.

### Proof
The invariant distribution $\pi$ satisfies:

$$\int P_{\text{mix}}(x, dy) \pi(x) dx = \gamma \int P_1(x, dy) \pi(x) dx + (1 - \gamma) \int P_2(x, dy) \pi(x) dx = \gamma \pi(dy) + (1 - \gamma) \pi(dy) = \pi(dy)$$

### Applications in Multimodal Distributions
- **Overcoming Local Traps:** In distributions with multiple modes, a single kernel might get trapped in one mode.
- **Enhanced Exploration:** By mixing kernels that explore different regions, we increase the chance of the chain moving between modes.
- **Adaptive MCMC:** Mixture kernels can be part of adaptive strategies that adjust the sampling process based on the chain's history.

## 6. Properties of MCMC Samples

Understanding the properties of samples generated by MCMC methods is crucial for their correct application and interpretation.

### Independence vs. Dependence in Samples
- **MCMC Samples are Dependent:** Unlike independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples, MCMC samples are correlated because each sample depends on the previous one.
- **Autocorrelation:** The degree of dependence can be quantified using autocorrelation functions.

### Convergence Diagnostics
- **Burn-in Period:** Initial samples may not represent the target distribution. Discarding a burn-in period helps ensure samples are from the stationary distribution.
- **Effective Sample Size:** Due to autocorrelation, the effective number of independent samples is less than the total number of MCMC samples.
- **Diagnostic Tools:** Use tools like trace plots, autocorrelation plots, and statistical tests to assess convergence.

### Practical Considerations
- **Mixing:** The ability of the chain to explore the state space efficiently. Poor mixing leads to slow convergence.
- **Chain Length:** Longer chains provide more samples but at increased computational cost.
- **Thinning:** Recording every $k$-th sample to reduce autocorrelation. However, thinning may not always be beneficial.
