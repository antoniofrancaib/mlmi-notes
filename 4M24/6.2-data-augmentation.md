## 1. Background on Bayesian Inference and MCMC

### Challenges in Sampling Complex Distributions
In Bayesian inference, we are often interested in computing the posterior distribution of parameters $\\theta$ given observed data $D$, denoted as $\\pi(\\theta) = p(\\theta \\mid D)$. However, for complex models or large datasets, this posterior distribution can be difficult to compute or sample from directly due to its high dimensionality or complicated structure.

### Introduction to Data Augmentation
Data augmentation is a technique that simplifies the sampling process by introducing additional latent variables (also called auxiliary variables or missing data) into the model. The idea is to augment the original parameter space to a higher-dimensional space where the augmented joint distribution is easier to sample from.

By designing a Markov chain that targets this augmented distribution and marginalizing out the auxiliary variables, we can obtain samples from the original target distribution.

## 2. Data Augmentation Framework

### Augmenting the Target Density
Consider a target density $\\pi(\\theta)$ where $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}^D$. The goal is to sample from this distribution. We introduce an auxiliary variable $\\phi \\in \\mathbb{R}^D$ to augment the model, defining a new joint distribution $\\pi(\\theta, \\phi)$. The augmented density must satisfy:

$$\\pi(\\theta) = \\int \\pi(\\theta, \\phi) \\, d\\phi$$

This equation ensures that the original target density $\\pi(\\theta)$ can be recovered by integrating out the auxiliary variable $\\phi$ from the joint distribution $\\pi(\\theta, \\phi)$.

### Marginalization and Recovery of the Original Distribution
By constructing a Markov chain whose invariant distribution is $\\pi(\\theta, \\phi)$, we can generate samples $\\{(\\theta^{(n)}, \\phi^{(n)})\\}$ from this joint distribution. The marginal distribution of $\\theta^{(n)}$ is then:

$$\\pi(\\theta^{(n)}) = \\int \\pi(\\theta^{(n)}, \\phi) \\, d\\phi$$

This means that each $\\theta^{(n)}$ is marginally distributed according to the original target density $\\pi(\\theta)$. Therefore, by sampling from the augmented joint distribution and discarding $\\phi$, we obtain samples from $\\pi(\\theta)$.

### Importance of Exact Conditional Distributions
The effectiveness of data augmentation hinges on our ability to sample from the conditional distributions $\\pi(\\theta \\mid \\phi)$ and $\\pi(\\phi \\mid \\theta)$. If these conditionals are of known form and can be sampled from directly, we can implement a Gibbs sampler to generate samples from $\\pi(\\theta, \\phi)$.

## 3. Binary Probit Regression Model

### Overview of Binary Probit Regression
Binary probit regression is a type of generalized linear model used for modeling binary response variables. It is widely used in statistics and machine learning for classification problems.

**Model Specification:** Let $t_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ be the binary response variable for observation $i$, and $x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^D$ be the corresponding predictor variables.

**Probability Model:**

$$p(t_i = 1 \\mid x_i, \\beta) = \\Phi(\\beta^T x_i)$$

where:

- $\\beta \\in \\mathbb{R}^D$ are the regression coefficients.
- $\\Phi(\\cdot)$ is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution.

### Limitations of Direct Sampling
Sampling from the posterior distribution $\\pi(\\beta \\mid t, X)$ in probit regression is challenging because the likelihood involves the normal CDF $\\Phi(\\cdot)$, which does not yield a conjugate posterior distribution for $\\beta$. This makes it difficult to compute or sample from the posterior directly.

## 4. Implementing Data Augmentation in Probit Regression

### Introducing the Latent Variable
To overcome the difficulties mentioned, we introduce a latent (auxiliary) variable $y_i$ for each observation $i$. The idea is to model an underlying continuous variable that determines the observed binary outcome.

**Latent Variable Model:**

$$y_i = \\beta^T x_i + \\epsilon_i, \\quad \\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, 1)$$

Here, $y_i$ is a continuous latent variable, and $\\epsilon_i$ represents random noise.

**Link to Observed Data:**

- If $y_i > 0$, we observe $t_i = 1$.
- If $y_i \\leq 0$, we observe $t_i = 0$.

This setup effectively connects the binary outcome $t_i$ to the latent continuous variable $y_i$ through a threshold at zero.

### Constructing the Joint Density
We can now define the joint probability of $t_i$ and $y_i$ given $x_i$ and $\\beta$:

$$p(t_i, y_i \\mid x_i, \\beta) = p(t_i \\mid y_i) \\cdot p(y_i \\mid x_i, \\beta)$$

**Likelihood of $t_i$ Given $y_i$:**

- For $t_i = 1$: $p(t_i = 1 \\mid y_i) = \\delta(y_i > 0)$
- For $t_i = 0$: $p(t_i = 0 \\mid y_i) = \\delta(y_i \\leq 0)$

Here, $\\delta(\\cdot)$ is the Dirac delta function, enforcing that $y_i$ must be consistent with the observed $t_i$.

**Density of $y_i$ Given $x_i$ and $\\beta$:**

$$p(y_i \\mid x_i, \\beta) = N(y_i \\mid \\beta^T x_i, 1)$$

### Conditional Distributions of Parameters
By augmenting the model with $y_i$, we can derive the conditional distributions needed for Gibbs sampling.

**Conditional Distribution of $\\beta$ Given $y$:**

Since $y_i$ are observed (in the augmented model), and $y_i$ are normally distributed given $\\beta$, the posterior distribution of $\\beta$ given $y$ and $X$ is also normal.

**Conditional Distribution of $y_i$ Given $\\beta$ and $t_i$:**

Each $y_i$ is sampled from a truncated normal distribution, truncated according to the observed $t_i$:

- If $t_i = 1$, $y_i$ is drawn from $N(\\beta^T x_i, 1)$ truncated to $y_i > 0$.
- If $t_i = 0$, $y_i$ is drawn from $N(\\beta^T x_i, 1)$ truncated to $y_i \\leq 0$.

## 5. Derivation of the Gibbs Sampler

### Full Conditional of the Regression Coefficients

We aim to find the conditional distribution $p(\\beta \\mid y, t, X)$.

**Likelihood Function:**

Since $y_i$ are conditionally independent given $\\beta$, the likelihood is:

$$L(\\beta) = \\prod_{i=1}^N p(y_i \\mid x_i, \\beta) = \\prod_{i=1}^N N(y_i \\mid \\beta^T x_i, 1)$$

**Prior Distribution:**

Assume a prior $\\pi_0(\\beta) = N(\\beta \\mid 0, \\Sigma)$.

**Posterior Distribution:**

The posterior is proportional to the likelihood times the prior:

$$p(\\beta \\mid y, t, X) \\propto L(\\beta) \\cdot \\pi_0(\\beta)$$

Since both the likelihood and prior are normal, the posterior is also normal.

**Resulting Posterior Distribution:**

$$p(\\beta \\mid y, t, X) = N(\\beta \\mid \\mu_\\beta, \\Sigma_\\beta)$$

where:

- $\\Sigma_\\beta = (X^T X + \\Sigma^{-1})^{-1}$
- $\\mu_\\beta = \\Sigma_\\beta X^T y$

### Full Conditional of the Latent Variables
We need to find $p(y_i \\mid \\beta, t_i, x_i)$ for each observation $i$.

**Conditional Density of $y_i$:**

Given $\\beta$ and $x_i$, $y_i$ follows a normal distribution truncated according to $t_i$:

- If $t_i = 1$: $y_i \\sim N(\\beta^T x_i, 1)$ truncated to $y_i > 0$.
- If $t_i = 0$: $y_i \\sim N(\\beta^T x_i, 1)$ truncated to $y_i \\leq 0$.

## 6. Gibbs Sampling Scheme for the Augmented Model

### Step-by-Step Algorithm
The Gibbs sampler iteratively samples from the conditional distributions derived above.

1. **Initialization:** Choose initial values for $\\beta^{(0)}$ and $y^{(0)}$.

2. **Iteration ($n \\geq 1$)**

   - Sample $\\beta^{(n)}$ given $y^{(n-1)}$ from $N(\\mu_{\\beta^{(n-1)}}, \\Sigma_{\\beta})$.
   - Sample $y^{(n)}$ given $\\beta^{(n)}$ and $t$:
     - For each $i = 1, \\dots, N$:
       - If $t_i = 1$, sample $y_i^{(n)}$ from $N(\\beta^{(n)T} x_i, 1)$ truncated to $y_i > 0$.
       - If $t_i = 0$, sample $y_i^{(n)}$ from $N(\\beta^{(n)T} x_i, 1)$ truncated to $y_i \\leq 0$.

3. **Repeat:** Continue iterating steps 1 and 2 for a sufficient number of iterations to allow the chain to converge to the stationary distribution.

### Practical Considerations
- **Sampling from Truncated Normal Distributions:** Efficient algorithms exist for sampling from truncated normal distributions, such as inverse transform sampling or rejection sampling.
- **Convergence Diagnostics:** Monitor the convergence of $\\beta^{(n)}$ using trace plots, autocorrelation functions, or formal statistical tests.
- **Burn-in Period:** Discard an initial set of samples (burn-in period) to ensure that the chain has reached the stationary distribution.
- **Thinning:** Optionally, thin the chain by keeping every $k$-th sample to reduce autocorrelation, though this may not always be necessary.

## 7. Advantages and Applications

### Benefits of Data Augmentation
- **Simplification of Sampling:** By introducing auxiliary variables, we transform a complex sampling problem into simpler subproblems with known distributions.
- **Efficient Computation:** Sampling from the conditional distributions is often computationally efficient, especially when they are standard distributions like the normal distribution.
- **Improved Mixing:** The Gibbs sampler can have better mixing properties in the augmented space, leading to faster convergence.

### Extensions to Other Models
Data augmentation is not limited to probit regression; it can be applied to a variety of models, including:

- **Logistic Regression:** Although logistic regression does not naturally lend itself to data augmentation with normal distributions, other techniques like the Polya-Gamma augmentation can be used.
- **Multinomial Models:** Extensions to multiclass classification problems using data augmentation techniques.
- **Latent Variable Models:** Models involving latent variables, such as factor analysis or hidden Markov models, can benefit from data augmentation.
